	<p>I can tell God liked this planet, because He put a ring on it. Well, actually there are rings around Jupiter, Uranus and Neptune too, but they're not as brilliantly beautiful as Saturn's. So, I guess God loves all the giant planets. He just plays favorites. You know the view is much better when you get closer to the planet and try to fly through the rings. You never know what you could see. Are you up to the challenge?</p>
