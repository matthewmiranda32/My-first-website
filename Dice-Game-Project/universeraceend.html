	<p>Here you are at the edge of the known Universe. You've made it farther than I've seen any space cadet has ever claimed to go! Great work! There's still one snag...You need to get home! Fortunately, I'm prepared to help you with this. You are being granted the all-mighty, all-powerful 20-sided die! No other dice has more power in the Universe! It is your ticket home!</p>
