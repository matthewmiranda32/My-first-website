   <p>Cinder cones are the simplest and most common type of volcano. They are made of made of tough hardened lava particles or volcanic cinders that form from large explosive vents which cool quickly and build up over time to form a cone-shaped hill. As the lava that forms them has hardened before it hits the ground, cinder cones feel more like sand dunes than solid hills. Because of their loose composition, cinder cone volcanoes often appear asymmetrical. One famous cinder cone volcano is Paracutin in Mexico.</p>
   <h2> Shield</h2>

   <p>Shield Volcanoes are flat low-lying volcanoes. They are formed from fluid lava flows that in more runny than explosive at eruption. Instead of becoming a high, towering mountain, the lava that forms sheild volcanoes piles up over time, forming a dome shaped mountain. In terms of surface area, shield volcanoes are some of the largest volcanoes on Earth. Mauna Kea in Hawaii is actually taller than Mt. Everest in terms of base-to-peak height. The Hawaiian islands are formed from a multitude of such volcanoes.</p>
   <h2>Composite</h2>

   <p>Composite volcanoes or stratovolcanoes are built up from multiple eruptions over long periods of time. They are formed from a conglomeration of lava and ash. The hardened lava and ash that forms them builds up into a steep, mountainous peak thousands of feet in the air. The eruptions from these volcanoes can be either very explosive or very runny, but are some of the most dangerous eruptions. Mt. Fuji in Japan, Mt. St. Helens in the United States and Pinatubo in the Phillipines are some famous composite volcanoes.</p>
