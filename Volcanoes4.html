         <h1> Volcanoes on Other Planets</h1>
         <p>We live on an active planet, but we're not alone. Other worlds in our Solar System are found to have volcanoes. Though most of them appear geologically dead there are some that still show signs of volcanic activity.</p>

         <h2>Mercury</h2>

         <p>Mercury was not initially thought to have much in the way of volcanoes. However, when the MESSENGER spacecraft photographed the surface in 2008, it found substantial evidence of such features. Though none are active currently, the volcanoes appear to have been responsible for many of Mercury's surface features.</p>

         <p>It's not easy to see the volcanoes on Venus due to the planet's thick cloud cover, but they are present. Radar observations from the Magellan spacecraft in the early '90s showed numerous volcanoes on the surface of Venus. Volcanic activity appears to have played a significant role in shaping the planet's surface. It is not known whether Venus has any currently active volcanoes.</p>

         <p>There aren't a great number of volcanic mountains on the Moon, but many features of our neighboring world have been formed by lava flows, the lunar maria being the most notable example. No volcanic activity is currently taking place on the Moon. Two volcanic domes can be seen here in this photo from the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter.</p>

         <p>Mars has some of the largest volcanoes in the entire Solar System. Its western hemisphere is dominated by the presence of four shield volcanoes. Three line up in a row forming the Tharsis Montes. To the northwest of them is Olympus Mons, a volcano three times higher than Mt. Everest. Many signifant lava plains, formed by volcanism are also present, but there is no evidence for current volcanic activity on Mars.</p>

         <p>As Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune are gas giants, no volcanoes are known to exist on them. However, one Jupiter's moons is quite an active place. Io is dotted with over 400 active volcanoes and lava flows, making it the most volcanically active world in the Solar System. Tidal heating caused by the gravitational pull of Jupiter and its other moons, keep Io's volcanoes contiuously erupting.</p>

         <p>On Saturn's moon Enceladus, a different type of volcanic activity takes place. At the south pole of Enceladus is a region known as the Tiger Stripes. From this region, a great number of ice volcanoes erupt water vapor into space. These ice volcanoes help to feed the rings of Saturn and give Enceladus a shiny appearance. Titan, another moon of Saturn is also thought to have similar volcanoes below its thick, orange atmoshphere.</p>

         <p>There are no known volcanic features on Uranus's moons.</p>

         <p>Neptune's moon Triton is a very cold place at -391 degrees F, yet it has volcanic activity of its own. Near the south pole, geysers erupt nitrogen gas into the moon's tenuous atmosphere. They can be seen as dark streak smearing the face of the Triton's polar cap. Like Venus, many of the surface features on Triton appear to have been formed due to volcanic eruption. Instead of lava, however, ice was the likely product of these eruptions.</p>

         <p>We have only recently paid a visit to dwarf planet Pluto and it appears that the former ninth planet has some surface features that resemble cryovolcanoes. The feature seen here is about 2.5 miles high and 90 miles across. While it has not been officially confirmed to be an ice volcano, it is among the largest such features in the outer Solar System.</p>
