   <h2> They're all over the world. They're on other planets. They're a window to Earth's interior. They're volcanoes and they're hot!!!</h2>
   <p>Volcanoes are typically mountain or hill-shaped formations where magma from Earth's mantle escapes to become hot flowing lava. They are typically found along the borders between two of Earth's tectonic plates. Depending on the movements of said plates, volcanoes can be tall and explosive or broad with a much more fluid flow of lava.
